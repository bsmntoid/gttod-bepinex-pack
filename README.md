## WHAT'S IN THE BOX:
 - BepInEx Mono 5.4.22
 - ~~Unstripped Unity 2021.3.31 `_data/Managed/` DLL files~~ Recent GTTOD Dev Branch update seemingly has code stripping disabled, not included anymore
 - A few config changes (enabled console, etc)
## INSTALLATION:
Drag and drop `BepInEx/`, `doorstop_config.dll` and `winhttp.dll` into the same folder as `Get To The Orange Door.exe`
